<h1>Social-Network-API</h1>

<h1>Description:</h1>
A set of API for a social network that uses a MongoDB database so that the website can handle large amounts of unstructured data, Express.js for routing, Mongoose ODM, and the moment package to format time stamps.


<h1>Testing:ðŸ’»ðŸ› </h1> 
Tested restful API calls with Insomnia Core

When you enter the command to invoke the application then the server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database.

Testing API GET routes in Insomnia Core for users and thoughts return the data for each of these routes in a formatted JSON

Testing API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core are able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts
